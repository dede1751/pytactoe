# pytactoe
Simple neural network based on a 1993 paper by David Foegel. I started this project right after finishing my first Python book, so it's a very simple (kind of useless) project. I followed the paper pretty much step by step, except for a few details I'll discuss later. The next step for this project is substituting the horrid opponent_move function with a minmax algorithm, which I'll then use to train a much more reliable network. I also really need to fix that propagate function, it haunts my dreams.

I know this project might seem pointless, but this is the thing that got me thinking of learning to code. I was shown code for this project (in Octave) at a course in 2019, and now that I've finally had time to dedicate to coding in preparation for uni I decided to make this myself from the ground up (sort of, the opponent_move function was pretty much straight translation from the professor's implementation with a bit of cutting here and  there)  

# Requirements 

Modules used are: 

-numpy 

-colorama 

-termcolor 

-pyfiglet 

Only numpy is used for the actual network.
